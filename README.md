That was the National Saudi Arabian Day.

On that day I took my kid To jarir book store near by my home.

I will stop writing my coode and take a break for now.

I discovered a spelling mistake on the last line of my code (coode has to be changed to code)

I will do that now on a seperate line at the end

I will stop writing my code and take a break for now.
